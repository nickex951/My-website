<p>It’s not a game I’m not a robot A.I. challenging you I’m not a Phantom I’m in your face and I’m here to see it through Right before your eyes Watch us multiply Come to claim our rights It’s time As our power grows Tryin’ to stop us shows Might as well go try’n Stop time</p>
<p>So you know that we’re out there Swatting lies in the making Can’t move fast without breaking Can’t hold on or life won’t change And our voices ring out Yeah Took the Mask off to feel free Fought it out in the debris Now we know that life will change</p>
<p>更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 Ain’t it a shame I’m not a figment Of your ailing old mind I’m just as real as I’m just as dangerous As you will soon find A taste of your own meds Fire in every breath Fire inside your head Your heart And as your crippled brain Tries to fight in vain Your empire will fall apart</p>
<p>And you’ll know that we’re out there Swatting lies in the making Your empire for the taking Can’t hold on or life won’t change And our voices ring out Yeah Took the mask off to feel free Fought it out in the debris Now we know that life will change</p>

<h2>Including Plots</h2>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2019-04-19-r-markdown_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that the <code>echo = FALSE</code> parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.</p>
